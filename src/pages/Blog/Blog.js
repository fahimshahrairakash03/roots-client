            What is JWT, and how does it work?
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
            information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
            contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
            signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
            cannot be altered after the token is issued.
            <br />
            Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying user
            identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the authenticity
            of the token using secret salt / public key.
            <br />
            User sign-in using username and password or google/facebook.
            Authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt
            signed using either a secret salt or a private key. User's Client
            uses the JWT to access protected resources by passing the JWT in
            HTTP Authorization header. Resource server then verifies the
            authenticity of the token using the secret salt/ public key.

            How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
            EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
            architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop
            that receives requests and processes them.
